# Is Subset Of

Check if a set is a strictly subset of a given set.

## Example - Comparison Of Numbers

Program:
```python
x = set {1, 2, 3};
y = set {1, 2};
z = y isSubOf x;
```

Output of variable z:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | True |

Program:
```python
x = set {1, 2, 3};
y = set {1, 2, 3, 4};
z = y isSubOf x;
```

Output of variable z:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | False |
