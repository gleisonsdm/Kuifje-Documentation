# Union

To perform the union of two sets, the operator is the plus.
Kuifje detect that both variables are sets, and creates a new set with all elements.
If a value is duplicated, 

## Example - Union of Sets

In the following scenario, the operator performs a union of the elements in both sets.
The program:
```python
x = set {1, 2};
y = set {2, 3};
z = x + y;
```

Output of variable z:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | S [ R 1.0, R 2.0, R 3.0 ] |
