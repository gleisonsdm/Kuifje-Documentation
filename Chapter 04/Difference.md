# Difference

To calculate the difference betweeen two sets, the symbol is the minus "-".
Kuifje will identify the variable types, and it creates a new set with the values present in the first set and that do not exists in the second set.

## Example - Difference of Sets

In the following scenario, the operator remove the elements of set A that are present in set B.
The program:
```python
x = set {1, 2, 3};
y = set {3, 4};
z = x - y;
```

Output of variable z:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | S [ R 1.0, R 2.0 ] |
