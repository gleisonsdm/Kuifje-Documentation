# Function Call

Functions are small packages of code, that can be easily reused due to modification in their parameters.
Kuifje functions are called as functions are called in Python.

```python
b = f1(prob01);
```

Example of function call:
```python
prob = (1 [1/3] 2);
prob01 <- prob;
...
b = f1(prob01);
leak(b);
```

The link "omplete Example of Function" shows a full implemented, compilable example of a function a how to call it.
