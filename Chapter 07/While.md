# While

While is a structure to iterate from one value to other, it is used to repeat a code for
a given number of times.

Example:
```sh
p = [0.3, 0.7];
i = 0;
while i < 2: 
  result = 0 [p] 1;
  leak(result);
  i = i + 1;
```

Output of variable p:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.29 | 0.16 | 0.3 |
| | 0.84 | 0.7 |
| 0.42 | 0.50 | 0.3 |
| | 0.50 | 0.7 |
| 0.29 | 0.84 | 0.3 |
| | 0.16 | 0.7 |

Output of variable result:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
