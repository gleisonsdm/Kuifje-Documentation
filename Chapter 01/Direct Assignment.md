# Direct Assignment

Describes an assignment created by the user, associating the probability to a value directly. 
The syntax is the same of Python dictionaries, considering just the subsets below.

Example:
```sh
  x := {'A': 0.25, 'B': 0.5, 'C': 0.25}
```

It is equivalent to:
```sh
  x := ['A', 'B', 'B', 'C']
```
Or:
| Value | Probability |
| --- | ----------- |
| A | 1/4 |
| B | 1/2 |
| C | 1/4 |
