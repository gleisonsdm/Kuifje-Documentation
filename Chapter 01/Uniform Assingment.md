# The uniform distribution

Describes a uniform distribution on the list of values.
(Gleison, here you should be exemplifying with sampling, not with assignment).

Example:
```sh
  x <- uniform [1, 2, 2, 3];
```

(Gleison, change output accordingly).

It is output follows:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 0.25 | 1.0 |
| | 0.50 | 2.0 |
| | 0.25 | 3.0 |
