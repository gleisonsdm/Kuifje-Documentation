# The uniform distribution

Describes a uniform distribution on the list of values.

Example:
```sh
  x <- uniform [1, 2, 2, 3];
```

It is output follows:
| Probability of the distribution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 0.25 | 1.0 |
| | 0.50 | 2.0 |
| | 0.25 | 3.0 |

# Uniform Set

Assign an uniform distribution to the elements of a given Set of values.

Example:
```sh
x <- uniform set {1, 2, 3};
```

The distribution generated is:
| Probability of the distribution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 0.33 | 1.0 |
| | 0.33 | 2.0 |
| | 0.33 | 3.0 |
