# Geometric Distribution

It is necessary support some distributions, to deal with real world scenarios and necessities of the user.
One of these distributions is the Geometric distribution, which is denetated as following.

The first parameter is the alpha that should be used.
The second is the lower bound integer value that the distribution will show.
The third parameter is the value where the distribution will be centered.
And the last parameter value is the highest value the distribution will present.

Example:
```sh
  x = geometric(1/2,0,0,4);
```

It represens a distribution such as:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 0.67 | 0.0 |
| | 0.17 | 1.0 |
| | 0.08 | 2.0 |
| | 0.04 | 3.0 |
| | 0.04 | 4.0 |
