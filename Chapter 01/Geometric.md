# Geometric Distribution

It is necessary support some distributions, to deal with real world scenarios and necessities of the user.
One of these distributions is the Geometric distribution, which is denatated as following.

Example:
```sh
  x = geometric(1/2,0,0,4);
```

It represens a distribution such as:
| Value | Probability |
| --- | ----------- |
| 0 | 2/3 |
| 1 | 1/6 |
| 2 | 1/12 |
| 3 | 1/24 |
| 4 | 1/24 |
