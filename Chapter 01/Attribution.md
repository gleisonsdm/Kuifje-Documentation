# Attributing probability distributions

To assign a probability distribution to a variable in Kuifje, the symbol "=" is used.

```python
  x = uniform [1,2,3];
```

The output of this command for variable "x" is:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 0.33 | 1 |
| | 0.33 | 2 |
| | 0.33 | 3 |
