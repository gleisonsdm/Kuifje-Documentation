# Sampling

Kuifje allow sampling from an existing distribution.
This is equivalent to create an instance from a pre defined distribution. For example:

```sh
  x = uniform [1,2,3];
  y <- x;
```

The symbol "<-" means create an object with the same values of x, and their same distribution should be respected.

It is also allowed to sample from the same distribution multiple times as below:
```sh
  x = uniform [1,2,3];
  y <- x;
  z <- x;
```
