```

Output or variable x:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.0 |

## Example - Distribution Subtraction

Program:
```python
y = uniform [1,2,3];
x = y - 1;
```

Output of variable x:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
