# Intersection operator

The intersection between two sets of values can be calculated as the example below

## Example - Intersection of two sets

Program:
```python
x = set {1, 2};
y = set {2, 3};
z = x & y;
```

Output or variable x:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | S [ R 1.0, R 2.0 ] |

Output or variable y:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | S [ R 2.0, R 3.0 ] |

Output or variable z:
| Probability of the disitrbution happen | Distribution | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.00 | 1.00 | S [ R 2.0 ] |
