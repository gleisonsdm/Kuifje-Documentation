# Plus operator

The plus operator can be used to add value to variables.

Example:
```sh
x := 2 + 1;
```
```sh
x := y + 1;
```

The operator can also be used to Add elements to a Set:
```sh
x := set {1, 2};
y := set {3};
z := x + y;
```

It is also possible to add an element each possible value of a distribution:
```sh
guess := uniform [0..10];
guess := guess + 1;
```
